# ResultCheckerApp

I'm building a Result Checker Application for an Institution with integration of a Database(Microsoft SQL Server)
...Here, I'll be using my alma mater as a case Study, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, Anambra State, NG.
My Department "Educational Management and Policy" as a benchmark because it has Electives/Options attached to the Course of Study.

This Web Application is built to Mitigate or solve the problem of holvering around the Departmental office to check results or getting to see results late. 

I will be making continous changes and commits whilst i build.
